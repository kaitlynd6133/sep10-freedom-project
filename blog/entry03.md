## Content
For plan B I thought of future innovations that would be useful for Business in the future. The first technology that I thought about was the infinite usb. I thought of this technology by thinking of ways of how many files and programs could be stored in a small usb. With this device, things can be stored without worrying about things getting deleted. This would be useful for business because this could prevent important documents and other things from being deleted or lost. Another future innovation that I thought of was robots that would help employees or workers with small tasks. I thought of robots that would help with cleaning offices, file organizing, and delivering things. This would be useful for business because when workers are busy with things, they could use robots to do things for them. The last future innovation that I thought of was emotion reading device. This could help read what customers think about the product. This is useful for business because it will imrpove satisfaction and form better communications for customers. 

## Engineeing Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process. I already finished researching on softwares and hardwares that are used for business. I also finished with thinking of future innovation technologies. I will start working on the project for the next step.

## Skills
The skills that Im working on is creativity and organization.

**Creativity**

I had to think outside of the box and think creativity. I had to experience with colors and fonts to make something look good. For example when I was doing my project, I had to think of ways to make the project look creative. Another example is when I was thinking of future innovations, I had to think of non exsistence technologies that would work for business. 

**Organization**

I learned how to seperate my partner's work and my work so that the amount of work that we do is divided fairly. I also had to organize my notes when working on the free code camp so when Im looking back at my notes, I could find what I needed easily.
