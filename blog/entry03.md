For plan B I thought of future innovations that would be useful for Business in the future. The first technology that I thought about was the infinite usb. I thought of this technology by thinking of ways of how many files and programs could be stored in a small usb. With this device, things can be stored without worrying about things getting deleted. This would be useful for business because this could prevent important documents and other things from being deleted or lost. Another future innovation that I thought of was robots that would help employees or workers with small tasks. I thought of robots that would help with cleaning offices, file organizing, and delivering things. This would be useful for business because when workers are busy with things, they could use robots to do things for them. The last future innovation that I thought of was emotion reading device. This could help read what customers think about the product. This is useful for business because it will imrpove satisfaction and form better communications for customers.
