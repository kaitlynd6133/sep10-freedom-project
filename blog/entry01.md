## Topic 

I've Decided On and Why The topic that i've decided on for my project is buisness and what machines are used in this field. I chose this topic becuase I find business captivating. It offers various career paths, high earning potiental, and provides opportunities to learn about how the world works. I was originally interested in sonography because I found it interesting that people could use technologies to make a difference in people's lives by detecting pregency complications and health issues. But, I found business more compelling because it often involves in strategic thinking and developing communication skills. 

## Backup Ideas

My backup ideas were to explore the field of ultrasound tech. I was curious about how sonographers can use different kinds of machines to capture sound waves and how they are able to scan the heart, liver, abdomen and many more. Another one of my backup idea was to look into veterinary where you get to treat animals with medical condititons and injuries. But, I decided to focus more on business because it aligns more closely with my long term interests and goals.
