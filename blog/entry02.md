## Content
I gathered many informations on software & hardware technologies that are used in business. I found alot of apps that are great for business. These are my favorite apps that I found: The first app that I found is Evernote. This app is great for notetaking, it allows people to share notes with others and it makes notes accesible offline. The second app that I found is Wave. This app is great for business owners to stay organized and get paid faster, it automate cash flow and expense tracking, direct intergrations with google sheets and have ecommerse features.
